## Images Are the Source Files

No \*.markinside file is created when you export an image from code — the image itself is the single source of truth. To edit an image's content, simply✱ open it in MarkInside.

<p class="note">✱ Some apps or services may compress PNG files and remove any embedded source code. If that happens, try exporting as SVG or PDF instead.</p>

## Live Preview

MarkInside provides a side-by-side editor with a live preview so changes to your code or settings are reflected immediately.

You can resize the preview area and change the canvas background color to better match the environment where you'll use the image.

## Use Everywhere

The files MarkInside generates are standard PNG, SVG, and PDF images. That means you can use them anywhere — no special renderer (for example, Mermaid) is required to view them.

## Power Up with Blocks & Templates

The block-based editor makes complex content easier to read and maintain. By organizing content into code blocks you can build reusable templates that extend what MarkInside can do.

See the [templates](/templates) we created to learn more.
